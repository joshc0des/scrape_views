# scrape_views
I was hired to make this web scraper for a local cannabis company. This application 
scrapes detailed info about every medical cannabis dispensary in Oklahoma. The 
output is a json file which can then easily be used in a multitude of ways. 

*This is a custom
solution and does not translate well to other projects.*
